### **Admin & Intel Ops - ID# 
#### Timestamp**
>
#### **Task Intel:**
- [ ] **Technical Research** (Medical/Technical/Specialized)
- [ ] **Financials** (Bills/Banking/Taxes)
- [ ] **Logistics** (Scheduling/Planning/Orders)
- [ ] **Digital Maintenance** (Filing/Vault Organizing)
- [ ] **Correspondence** (Inquiries/Official Emails)
- [ ] **Other:** 
>
#### **Performance Metrics:**
- [ ] **Deep Focus** (Sustained cognitive processing)
- [ ] **Data Synthesis** (Connected complex dots)
- [ ] **Dexterity Tax** (Strain from typing/mouse work)
- [ ] **System Lag** (Fought through brain fog/fatigue)
- [ ] **Acoustic Peace** (Was it quiet enough to focus?)
- [ ] **Objective Secured** (Task completed successfully)
#### **Combat Event Log (Sub-Snippets)**
> [!danger]+ **Black Box Recording: Tactical Micro-Logs**
> Use this section to capture real-time hardware errors and system hits as they occur during the mission. By documenting the "Live Feed," you identify exactly which environmental variables (sound, surface, social tax) trigger specific system failures.

> [!ABSTRACT]- ⚡ Combat Trigger Reference
> | Trigger | Name | Use Case |
> | :--- | :--- | :--- |
> | `\brain` | **Cognitive Load** | Zoning out, doom-scrolling, or word-recall failure. |
> | `\comms` | **Comm Log** | Energy cost of texts, emails, or brand DMs. |
> | `\crash` | **System Failure** | **Emergency use only.** Total shutdown or medical crisis. |
> | `\field-med` | **Intervention** | Pain Protocol (TENS/Heat) and Chemical Load (K+). |
> | `\gear` | **Hardware Scan** | Somatic Error Codes (Ice-water, Battle-ax, Edema). |
> | `\intel` | **Tactical Pivot** | New patterns or finding something that works. |
> | `\parts` | **Internal Sync** | Settling "Honors Student" vs. "The Critic" arguments. |
> | `\war` | **Combat Log** | External friction (Bureaucracy/Conflict). |
> | `\worth` | **Value Audit** | Shield against the "Utility Trap" or feeling like a "burden." |
> | `\reset` | **System Reset** | Vagal/Sensory "Reboot" to stop a flare or crash cycle. |
>  ---
> **Tactical Advice:** 
> > Don't overthink the notes. A simple checkmark and a one-sentence "Incident Note" is a successful mission.
> * If you log a `\gear` error, try to follow it up with a `\field-med` or `\reset` to show you're taking the initiative.

#### **Somatic Impact (Physical Reality):**
*(Describe the "Hardware Lag": Did the deep research trigger "System Lag" or brain fog? Did the sitting position impact the spine/Arachnoiditis?)*
>
#### **Emotional Intel (Identity & Worth):**
*(Technical research can be empowering or draining. Did this feel like gaining an advantage, or did it feel like a heavy burden of "Self-Management"?)*
>
#### **Supplemental Log (AAR)** 
_(Extra context or stray thoughts that don't fit the categories above.)_
