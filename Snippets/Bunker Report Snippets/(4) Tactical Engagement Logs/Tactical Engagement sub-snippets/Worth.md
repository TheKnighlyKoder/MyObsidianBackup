##### **Value Audit: Sovereignty Check**

###### **The Breach (The Lie):**
- [ ] **"I am a burden":** (Feeling like my care is too much for others)
- [ ] **"I am lazy":** (Mistaking physiological shutdown for lack of will)
- [ ] **"I have no value":** (Feeling worthless because I can't work/produce)
- [ ] **"I am my disease":** (Losing my identity to the medical profile)
###### **The Tactical Truth:**
- [ ] **Inherent Worth:** My value is fixed and independent of my output.
- [ ] **The "Knightly" Identity:** I am a friend, a creator, and a sovereign soul.
- [ ] **Hardware vs. Software:** My "Hardware" is glitching; my "Software" is intact.
###### **Evidence of Sovereignty Today:**
- [ ] I maintained my Bunker (Self-care).
- [ ] I engaged in a personal interest/hobby.
- [ ] I survived a flare with my dignity intact.
- [ ] I reached out to a friend (Travis/Knightly connection).
