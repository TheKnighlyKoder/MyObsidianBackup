#### **Combat Event Log (Sub-Snippets)**
> [!danger]+ **Black Box Recording: Tactical Micro-Logs**
> Use this section to capture real-time hardware errors and system hits as they occur during the mission. By documenting the "Live Feed," you identify exactly which environmental variables (sound, surface, social tax) trigger specific system failures.

> [!ABSTRACT]- ⚡ Combat Trigger Reference
> | Trigger | Name | Use Case |
> | :--- | :--- | :--- |
> | `\brain` | **Cognitive Load** | Zoning out, doom-scrolling, or word-recall failure. |
> | `\comms` | **Comm Log** | Energy cost of texts, emails, or brand DMs. |
> | `\crash` | **System Failure** | **Emergency use only.** Total shutdown or medical crisis. |
> | `\field-med` | **Intervention** | Pain Protocol (TENS/Heat) and Chemical Load (K+). |
> | `\gear` | **Hardware Scan** | Somatic Error Codes (Ice-water, Battle-ax, Edema). |
> | `\intel` | **Tactical Pivot** | New patterns or finding something that works. |
> | `\parts` | **Internal Sync** | Settling "Honors Student" vs. "The Critic" arguments. |
> | `\war` | **Combat Log** | External friction (Bureaucracy/Conflict). |
> | `\worth` | **Value Audit** | Shield against the "Utility Trap" or feeling like a "burden." |
> | `\reset` | **System Reset** | Vagal/Sensory "Reboot" to stop a flare or crash cycle. |
>  ---
> **Tactical Advice:** 
> > Don't overthink the notes. A simple checkmark and a one-sentence "Incident Note" is a successful mission.
> * If you log a `\gear` error, try to follow it up with a `\field-med` or `\reset` to show you're taking the initiative.

#### **Somatic Impact (Physical Reality):**
 *(Describe the specific hardware failure: the "Ice Water" bone pain, the tremors, or the dexterity loss in detail.)*
>
#### **Emotional Intel (Identity & Worth):**
*(Address the "Utility Trap" here. How did it feel to struggle with the task? How are you separating your value from your output today?)*
>
#### **Supplemental Log (AAR)**
