## Level 1: Sweet & Very Mild (<2,500 SHU)

### Habanada (0–1,000 SHU)

- **Description:** A revolutionary open-pollinated pepper bred at Cornell University. It looks exactly like a small, wrinkled orange Habanero but has zero heat.
    
- **Taste Profile:** Incredible tropical flavor with notes of apricot, melon, and guava. It provides the famous "Habanero aroma" without the burn.
    
- **Why It's a Good Option:** It allows you to add massive tropical flavor to a dish without making it too spicy for those with sensitive GI systems or low heat tolerance.
    
- **Primary Uses:** Fresh snacking, tropical salsas, or sautéed with vegetables.
    
- **Dehydration for Rehydration:** **Excellent.** Since it has no heat, you can use large pieces to add a "fruit basket" aroma to winter cooking. The sweetness concentrates beautifully when dried.
    

### <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Grenada Seasoning (500–1,000 SHU)</span>

- **Description:** A classic Caribbean seasoning pepper. It is a _C. chinense_ variety that produces yellow, wrinkled pods with the texture of a Habanero but very little spice.
    
- **Taste Profile:** Citrusy and bright with a distinct "perfumed" aroma typical of West Indian cooking.
    
- **Why It's a Good Option:** It is a essential "foundation" pepper for building deep flavor in stews and rice dishes without overwhelming the palate with heat.
    
- **Primary Uses:** Sautéed into "sofrito" bases, rice and beans, or fish dishes.
    
- **Dehydration for Rehydration:** **Good.** The pieces rehydrate well and provide a savory, aromatic background that makes a dish feel more complex.
    

### Tangerine Dream (0–1,000 SHU)

- **Description:** A beautiful, small, bushy plant that produces dozens of 3-inch, bright orange, tapered pods. It is highly ornamental.
    
- **Taste Profile:** Very sweet and crunchy with a light, citrus-orange finish. Almost no heat.
    
- **Why It's a Good Option:** Because the plant is small and stunningly colorful, it’s a great "video/photo" pepper. The fruit is very "snackable."
    
- **Primary Uses:** Fresh eating, pickling whole, or as a colorful garnish.
    
- **Dehydration for Rehydration:** **Fair.** The walls are a bit thinner, so they dry fast. Use them in winter cooking purely for a boost of sweetness and orange color.
    

### Cristal (0–500 SHU)

- **Description:** Known in Spain as the "Foie Gras of Peppers." They are long, thin-skinned, and very delicate.
    
- **Taste Profile:** Remarkably sweet and rich. When roasted, the flavor becomes deep and luxurious.
    
- **Why It's a Good Option:** These are rare in the US and considered a gourmet delicacy. The thin skin is very easy on the digestion.
    
- **Primary Uses:** Traditionally fried in olive oil or roasted and served as a side dish.
    
- **Dehydration for Rehydration:** **Good.** Because the skin is so thin, the pieces rehydrate almost instantly in hot broth, lending a rich, Spanish-style sweetness to soups.
    

### Corno Di Toro Yellow (0 SHU)

- **Description:** "Horn of the Bull." An Italian heirloom that produces large, 8-10 inch curved yellow peppers.
    
- **Taste Profile:** Deeply sweet and crisp. It has more "substance" than a bell pepper.
    
- **Why It's a Good Option:** It provides bulk and sweetness. For someone dealing with muscle wasting or needing nutrient-dense meals, this provides a lot of "pepper meat" for the effort.
    
- **Primary Uses:** Roasting, stuffing, or grilling.
    
- **Dehydration for Rehydration:** **Fair.** Like most large sweet peppers, they take a while to dry. The dried chunks are best used in slow-simmered stews where they have time to plump back up.
    

### <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Habanero Sweet Orange (500–1,000 SHU)</span>

- **Description:** A "heat-less" Habanero variety. It produces the classic lantern-shaped pods but with the fire removed.
    
- **Taste Profile:** Very floral and fruity. It has a "bright" taste that cuts through heavy, fatty foods.
    
- **Why It's a Good Option:** Great for adding that "fancy" Habanero scent to Travis's meals without the risk of triggering inflammation or "surface hypersensitivity" from capsaicin.
    
- **Primary Uses:** Salsas, fruit salads, or flavoring oils.
    
- **Dehydration for Rehydration:** **Good.** The pieces hold their floral scent quite well after drying.
    

### Acoma (1,000–2,500 SHU)

- **Description:** A rare Native American heirloom from the Acoma Pueblo. It is a New Mexico-style green/red chili.
    
- **Taste Profile:** Earthy, sweet, and mild. It has a "traditional" Southwestern flavor.
    
- **Why It's a Good Option:** It’s a hardy plant and a piece of agricultural history. It’s a very "comfortable" heat for everyday use.
    
- **Primary Uses:** Roasting and peeling, or making mild red chili sauce.
    
- **Dehydration for Rehydration:** **Excellent.** Like most Pueblo peppers, it was born to be dried. Dried pieces add a wonderful earthy thickness to winter broths.

## Level 2: Gentle Warmth (2,500–5,000 SHU)

### <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Chilhuacle Amarillo / Amarillo Long</span> (2,000–5,000 SHU)

- **Description:** A rare Oaxacan heirloom. "Chilhuacle" means "ancient chili." These are becoming very hard to find.
    
- **Taste Profile:** Notes of lemon, balsamic, and dark fruit. It is much more complex than a standard yellow pepper.
    
- **Why It's a Good Option:** This is a "chef's pepper." If you want to make an authentic _Mole Amarillo_, this is the only way to do it.
    
- **Primary Uses:** The primary ingredient in yellow mole; also great for gourmet sauces.
    
- **Dehydration for Rehydration:** **Superior.** This pepper is almost exclusively used in its dried form. The pieces rehydrate into a silky, flavor-packed addition for chicken or fish stews.
    

### Fresno (2,500–5,000 SHU)

- **Description:** Looks like a Jalapeño but grows pointing **upward** when young and has thinner walls. It ripens to a brilliant red.
    
- **Taste Profile:** Similiar to a Jalapeño but much fruitier and slightly more acidic/smoky when red.
    
- **Why It's a Good Option:** It’s faster to ripen and more flavor-complex than a Jalapeño. Since it ripens red quickly, it's better for your dehydration goals.
    
- **Primary Uses:** Fresh salsas, hot sauce, or pickling.
    
- **Dehydration for Rehydration:** **Excellent.** Because the walls are thinner than a Jalapeño, they dry better and rehydrate with a much better texture in winter chili.

## Level 3: Medium Heat (5,000–10,000 SHU)

### <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Gochugaru</span> / Korean Chili (4,000–8,000 SHU)

- **Description:** The traditional pepper used to make Korean chili flakes. It produces long, slender red pods.
    
- **Taste Profile:** Smoky, sweet, and slightly sun-dried tasting even when fresh.
    
- **Why It's a Good Option:** It is bred specifically for drying. It has a very high sugar content which makes the dried pieces taste incredibly rich.
    
- **Primary Uses:** Making Kimchi, Korean stews (_Jjigae_), or general seasoning.
    
- **Dehydration for Rehydration:** **Superior.** This is arguably the best "flavoring" pepper to dry in pieces. It rehydrates into a soft, sweet, and mild-medium spicy addition to any meal.
    

### <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Zebrange </span>(5,000–10,000 SHU)

- **Description:** A stunning cross between an Aji Fantasy and a Christmas Bell. The pods are "saucer" shaped with **striking orange and red stripes**.
    
- **Taste Profile:** Very citrusy (lemon/lime) and crisp. The heat is mostly in the center, while the "wings" of the pepper are sweet.
    
- **Why It's a Good Option:** This is a "wow" pepper for your photography/video. The stripes are incredible.
    
- **Primary Uses:** Fresh salads, pickling, or as a garnish to show off the stripes.
    
- **Dehydration for Rehydration:** **Good.** The pieces look beautiful dried. The citrus flavor remains sharp and helps brighten up heavy winter soups.
    

### <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Turkish Flower Biber</span> (5,000–10,000 SHU)

- **Description:** A rare Turkish variety where the peppers grow in **upright clusters** that look like a bouquet of flowers.
    
- **Taste Profile:** Sweet, slightly salty/savory, with a medium kick.
    
- **Why It's a Good Option:** Since you liked the **Super Chili**, you will love this. It grows the same way (upright clusters) but has a much more "old world" savory flavor.

### <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Queen Laurie </span>(15,000–30,000 SHU)

- **Description:** A tall, lanky _C. baccatum_ from Peru. It produces 4-inch long, bright orange, slender pods.

- **Taste Profile:** Clean, sharp, acidic heat. Not much sweetness, just pure "spice."
