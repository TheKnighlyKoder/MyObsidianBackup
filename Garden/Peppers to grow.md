## 1. Habanero Sweet Orange (0 – 500 SHU)

- **Botanical Profile:** A _C. chinense_ variety. The plant is typically a compact, sturdy bush (24–30 inches) that produces heavy yields of 2-inch lantern-shaped pods.
    
- **Taste Profile:** It possesses the "Habanero paradox"—all the floral, apricot, and tropical fruit aromatics without the capsaicin. It has a high sugar content and a very "clean" finish.
    
- **Why it's a good option:** It allows you to build a "tropical" flavor base in a dish that can then be heat-adjusted with other peppers. It is the perfect "safe" aromatic.
    
- **Primary Uses:** Fresh snacking, tropical "faux-hot" sauces, and finely diced in salads.
    
- **Dehydration & Rehydration:** **Medium-thick walls.** These take about 8–10 hours to dry. Because of the sugar, they can be slightly sticky. When rehydrated, they become soft and "jammy," perfect for thickening a sauce.
    
- **Heat Comparison:** **Bell Pepper.**
    

## 2. Grenada Seasoning (500 – 1,000 SHU)

- **Botanical Profile:** A Caribbean _C. chinense_ heirloom. The plant is slightly more sprawling than the Sweet Orange. Pods are thinner-skinned and more wrinkled.
    
- **Taste Profile:** Known for its "perfumed" complexity. It has a distinct savory, herbal quality with a citrus-peel bitterness that adds "adult" sophistication to food.
    
- **Why it's a good option:** This is a "foundation pepper." In Caribbean cooking, this is used like garlic or onions—a non-negotiable flavor base.
    
- **Primary Uses:** The "Holy Trinity" of stews: sautéed with onions and garlic as the start of every meal.
    
- **Dehydration & Rehydration:** **Thin walls.** Dries very quickly (6–8 hours). Because they are thin, the dried shards "melt" into a stew almost instantly upon rehydration, infusing the broth with scent.
    
- **Heat Comparison:** **Mild Pepperoncini.**
    

## 3. Chilhuacle Amarillo (2,000 – 5,000 SHU)

- **Botanical Profile:** An ancient _C. annuum_ from the Cañada region of Oaxaca. It is a rare "landrace" pepper, meaning it has evolved specifically for its local environment over centuries.
    
- **Taste Profile:** Extremely nuanced. It features notes of sun-dried lemon, dark honey, and a hint of smoky tobacco. It is savory rather than sugary.
    
- **Why it's a good option:** It provides an "Old World" gourmet flavor that is impossible to find in commercial produce. It makes a dish feel "expensive."
    
- **Primary Uses:** Making the legendary _Mole Amarillo_. It is also incredible in cream-based soups or with shellfish.
    
- **Dehydration & Rehydration:** **Medium walls.** Specifically bred for drying. The skin becomes matte and papery when dry. It rehydrates into a silky, velvet-like texture that blends beautifully into smooth sauces.
    
- **Heat Comparison:** **Mild Jalapeño.**
    

## 4. Gochugaru / Korean Chili (4,000 – 8,000 SHU)

- **Botanical Profile:** A _C. annuum_ bred for the Korean climate. The plants produce 5–6 inch long, slender red pods that hang down like fingers.
    
- **Taste Profile:** It has a "sun-kissed" sweetness. There is a deep, raisin-like fruitiness and a very subtle, natural smokiness even without being smoked.
    
- **Why it's a good option:** It is the most versatile red pepper. It provides a massive amount of "red chili flavor" without the aggressive sting of a Cayenne.
    
- **Primary Uses:** Kimchi, but also the best choice for "Red Chili" style stews.
    
- **Dehydration & Rehydration:** **Medium walls.** High sugar content means they should be dried at a lower temperature ($125^{\circ}F$ / $52^{\circ}C$) to avoid scorching the sugars. Rehydrated pieces stay "meaty" and hold their shape in a long-simmered chili.
    
- **Heat Comparison:** **Standard Jalapeño.**
    

## 5. Zebrange (5,000 – 10,000 SHU)

- **Botanical Profile:** A _C. baccatum_ cross. The plant is tall, lanky, and "vine-like," often reaching 4–5 feet. The "saucer" pods are visually striking with their stripes.
    
- **Taste Profile:** Very "bright." It has a sharp, lime-zest acidity and a crisp, watery crunch. The heat is a "spark" that hits the tongue quickly and disappears fast.
    
- **Why it's a good option:** It is the "Acid" component in cooking. Use it where you would normally use a squeeze of lime or a splash of vinegar.
    
- **Primary Uses:** Sliced fresh over fatty meats (like pork belly) or pickled in white vinegar to preserve the stripes.
    
- **Dehydration & Rehydration:** **Crisp, thin walls.** Dries into "shingles" that stay quite stiff. When rehydrated, they provide a bit of "bite" or texture to a dish rather than turning to mush.
    
- **Heat Comparison:** **Hot Jalapeño or Serrano.**
    

## 6. Turkish Flower Biber (5,000 – 10,000 SHU)

- **Botanical Profile:** A _C. annuum_ from Turkey. It grows in upright "clusters" of 5–10 pods at the end of each branch. Very easy on the back/hands during harvest.
    
- **Taste Profile:** Earthy, salty, and robust. It lacks the "fruitiness" of the Ajis, favoring a more traditional, savory "pepper" flavor.
    
- **Why it's a good option:** It is the easiest to process. You can hang the whole clusters to air-dry or snip them into the dehydrator with minimal effort.
    
- **Primary Uses:** Making "Silk Chili" flakes (rubbed with a little salt and oil after drying).
    
- **Dehydration & Rehydration:** **Thin, papery walls.** Dries very brittle. Perfect for grinding into a coarse "pizza-style" flake that adds a savory warmth to winter soups.
    
- **Heat Comparison:** **Serrano.**
    

## 7. Aji Lemon Drop (15,000 – 30,000 SHU)

- **Botanical Profile:** A Peruvian _C. baccatum_. A sprawling, "wild" looking bush that can produce 100+ pods in a season.
    
- **Taste Profile:** A literal "Lemon" flavor. It is shockingly citrusy, with a sharp, piercing heat that "stings" rather than "glows."
    
- **Why it's a good option:** It is the best pepper for fish and poultry. The lemon flavor isn't just a hint—it’s the primary note.
    
- **Primary Uses:** Hot sauces, seasoning for grilled fish, or "Lemon-Chili" salt.
    
- **Dehydration & Rehydration:** **Very thin walls.** Dries into neon-yellow "chips." They rehydrate instantly. They are best used in "light" broths where the citrus oil can really shine.
    
- **Heat Comparison:** **3x-4x Hotter than a Jalapeño.**
    

## 8. Queen Laurie (15,000 – 30,000 SHU)

- **Botanical Profile:** A tall, slender _C. baccatum_. This plant needs a lot of vertical support and has a very long growing season.
    
- **Taste Profile:** "Spicy Berry." It has a tropical, passionfruit sweetness that is very dense and sugary.
    
- **Why it's a good option:** It represents the "Sweet" end of the hot pepper spectrum. It’s perfect for balancing out salty or sour ingredients.
    
- **Primary Uses:** Sliced into stir-fries or used as a base for a "Sweet Chili" dipping sauce.
    
- **Dehydration & Rehydration:** **Medium-thin walls.** The sugar content makes these very flavorful when dried. They provide a "fruit-pop" when you bite into a rehydrated piece in a stew.
    
- **Heat Comparison:** **Mild Cayenne.**
    

## 9. Aji Mango (30,000 – 60,000 SHU)

- **Botanical Profile:** A _C. baccatum_ from South America. Produces smooth, teardrop-shaped pods that turn from green to a beautiful mango-orange.
    
- **Taste Profile:** It smells exactly like a ripe mango. The flavor is a mix of tropical fruit and a sharp, clean capsaicin bite.
    
- **Why it's a good option:** It bridges the gap between a "flavor" pepper and a "heat" pepper. It does both at a high level.
    
- **Primary Uses:** Tropical salsas, glaze for chicken wings, or paired with pork.
    
- **Dehydration & Rehydration:** **Medium walls.** Because of its juiciness, it takes longer to dry (10–12 hours). The dried pieces are very potent—a small amount of this dried fruit goes a long way.
    
- **Heat Comparison:** **Standard Cayenne.**
    

## 10. Golden & Purple Cayenne (30,000 – 50,000 SHU)

- **Botanical Profile:** _C. annuum_. Purple Cayenne is highly ornamental with dark foliage; Golden is a waxy yellow. Both are very reliable and fast-growing.
    
- **Taste Profile:** Pure, "utilitarian" heat. It is sharp, stinging, and slightly acidic. Not much sweetness, just a clean burn.
    
- **Why it's a good option:** The "Heat Control." If a stew isn't hot enough, you add these. They don't change the flavor profile of the dish; they just "turn up the volume" on the spice.
    
- **Primary Uses:** Dried flakes and powders.
    
- **Dehydration & Rehydration:** **Thin, papery walls.** The "Gold Standard" for drying. They become extremely brittle and can be crushed into powder between your fingers.
    
- **Heat Comparison:** **Standard Cayenne.**
    

## 11. Sugar Rush Peach (50,000 – 100,000 SHU)

- **Botanical Profile:** A _C. baccatum_ created by Chris Fowler. It has a very long ripening period (be patient with it!). Pods are peach-colored and often have a "belly-button" at the tip.
    
- **Taste Profile:** The peak of pepper breeding. It is "cloyingly sweet" followed by a massive, building, tropical heat. It tastes like spicy peach nectar.
    
- **Why it's a good option:** It is the "Superstar" of the garden. Everyone who tries it is blown away by the sweetness-to-heat ratio.
    
- **Primary Uses:** Hot honey (steep dried pieces in honey) or high-end hot sauces.
    
- **Dehydration & Rehydration:** **Thick walls for an Aji.** They take a long time to dry (12+ hours). Because they are so thick, the rehydrated pieces are very "fleshy" and substantial—almost like adding pieces of spicy sun-dried tomato to a dish.
    
- **Heat Comparison:** **Thai Chili / Low-end Habanero.**
