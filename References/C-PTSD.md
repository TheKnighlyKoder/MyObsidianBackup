# 📖 C-PTSD & CTSD: Technical Glossary

Use these terms to label your `/war` and `/gear` logs. This turns "noise" into "data."

## 1. Emotional Flashback
* **Definition:** Unlike a visual flashback (seeing a war zone), this is an intense, sudden "loading" of a past emotional state (e.g., feeling small, worthless, or terrified) without a clear visual memory.
* **The Signal:** A sudden spike in the **Inner Critic** or the **Utility Trap**.
* **Common Trigger:** A specific tone of voice or a "Miracle" comment.

## 2. Hypervigilance
* **Definition:** The system is stuck in "High-Gain" sensor mode. The brain is constantly scanning for threats in the environment, even in the Bunker.
* **The Signal:** Jumping at small noises, inability to relax even when alone, or high **SNHL Fatigue**.
* **Hardware Cost:** Massive drain on the battery (Cortex).

## 3. The Fawn Response (The Honors Student)
* **Definition:** A survival strategy where the person tries to "appease" a threat by being helpful, productive, or "perfect." 
* **The Signal:** The feeling that you must provide **Utility** to have the right to exist.
* **Connection:** This is the root of Travis's "Honors Student" mask.

## 4. Somatic Armoring (The Clench)
* **Definition:** Rhythmic or chronic muscle tension held in the body as a "shield" against expected pain or judgment.
* **The Signal:** **Code: Clench** in the jaw, shoulders, or chest.
* **Travis's Note:** This is often the first sign of a flare before the **CKD/RTA** pain even starts.

## 5. Functional Freeze (The Crying Lock)
* **Definition:** A state where the body is "On" but the person feels numb, cold, or "behind glass." You can still "function" (do tasks), but you are emotionally offline.
* **The Signal:** The **Crying Lock** or feeling like a "specimen."

## 6. Inner Critic
* **Definition:** A "Software Program" created during childhood to keep you safe by "beating you to the punch." It insults you so you'll try harder to be perfect and avoid external punishment.
* **The Signal:** Harsh internal dialogue ("You're a burden," "You're lazy").
