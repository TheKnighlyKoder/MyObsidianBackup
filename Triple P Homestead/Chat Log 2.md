Brightspeed is upgrading its network from PPPOE to DHCP to provide you with the best service. Your area will undergo a network update sometime in the next few days. This change should cause very little downtime, and your internet should come back on its own. If you have an older modem or gateway, you may need to restart it or perform a factory reset. If you use your own router, you might need to update its settings.

Welcome to Brightspeed, I'm Alvin

Alvin2:53 pm

Hi Travis, thank you for chatting Brightspeed. My name is Alvin. I'll be your account specialist. I'll be more than happy to assist you with your concern.

Me2:53 pm

Hello, I just got off the chat with another agent about an invalid late fee. They said they were going to credit it but when I look they only took 26.79 off not the $42 that the late fee was, Why?

Alvin2:54 pm

Thank you for raising this concern. I will do everything I can to help you today.!

Let me go ahead and pull up your account. One moment please

Me3:02 pm

Still here?

Alvin3:04 pm

I apologize for delay response, I am checking the documentation here however I don't see a notes regarding the late fee credit

When did you reach out with us?

Me3:05 pm

About 3-5 minutes before I talked to you

I believe the Agent's name was Ronald

Alvin3:06 pm

May I know why you are requesting the late fee to be remove?

Me3:07 pm

Because if you look at the bill you can see it was marked as paid on the 6th of Jan when the due date is the 24th each month so there is no way it was late and there was no late fee from the month before so it is a error on your side

Alvin3:13 pm

I apologize, yes already double check and should not have a late fee charge.

I will issued a credit for this late fee charges however this will take effect on your next bill.

I apologize that is the process of our credit since we don't have a real time credit.

Me3:14 pm

So I have to pay it now and then next bill will be less?

If you do not have a real time credit, then how did the other agent remove $26.79 from the current bill?

Alvin3:18 pm

That is correct.

Next bill the credit that I issued will be automatically deducted.

Me3:18 pm

While you are looking at my account, please explain to me why I am being charged $13.99 for a Lease Ship Overnight when I have never made an order to Brightspeed and never received anything from them. My modem is still marked CenturyLink from before

your company bought them. Based on the cost of my monthly bill, it seems this as been part of my bill every month. So why am I having to pay the $13.99?

Alvin3:19 pm

May I know if the previous rep you mentioned was from chat?

Me3:20 pm

He said he was going to credit the account for the late fee. I then logged back into my account and what it shows online as being due is $26.79 less the the paper bill and what it was before I talked to the other Agent

It was an agent on this chat system, yes

Alvin3:21 pm

Your account is grandfathered, we take over your service from Century link however we can't make changes on your lease modem since with Brightspeed, the modem is already included in our basic plan which is $65.

Currently your service plan is $54.45

Me3:21 pm

So the $13.99 if the cost of the monthly rent for the modem? If so why is it marked as shipping?

Alvin3:22 pm

I don't see credit that process today that already take effect on your account.

I see here that the credit process today will take effect on 3/1

I apologize that is what the system put on that line item however that is a rental or lease modem

Me3:24 pm

So why does did it change from $194.84 to $168.05 after talking to the other agent when I log into my account to see what I owe for my Feb bill?

Alvin3:26 pm

I apologize, I don't see that in my end but I can guarantee that no credit issued today that take effect immediately

Because the credit I see here are all will reflect on 3/1

Me3:27 pm

So do I owe the 194.84 or the 168.05 that my online account shows as the current due

Alvin3:29 pm

$168.05 is your balance

Me3:30 pm

It is now, but if you look at the paper bill they mailed me and what the account was before I talked to the other Agent it was 194.84

So while you do not see it or understand how he did it, the other agent did credit the account today just not for the full 42 that the late fee was

Alvin3:31 pm

Based on what I am seeing on your account, it is $168.05 and no credit today was reflected on your service

All credit processed 2/12 are all will take effect on 3/1

Me3:31 pm

Well then the other agent has to be magic.

Alvin3:32 pm

I apologize, that is what I am seeing here on your account.

Me3:33 pm

Well I know you did not make the system but this is the dumbest system I have ever seen. Sorry you have to deal with it.

Alvin3:34 pm

I am really sorry for the experience. I just don't have an option for real time credit on our end.

Me3:34 pm

Whatever. Thanks for your time.

What amount does the credit that will process on the 1st say it is?

Alvin3:42 pm

I see here that the total amount that process today is $25.66

Me3:43 pm

Whatever, none of this makes any sense. All of your numbers are strange and do not reflect anything I can seen. Seems like Brightspeed has a very flawed system.
