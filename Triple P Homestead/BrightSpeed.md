my sincere apologies to correct this one can you please reach out to our customer service 833-692-7773

While you are looking at my account, please explain to me why I am being charged $13.99 for a Lease Ship Overnight when I have never made an order to Brightspeed and never received anything from them. My modem is still marked CenturyLink from before your company bought them. Based on the cost of my monthly bill, it seems this as been part of my bill every month. So why am I having to pay the $13.99? 



Hello, I just got off the chat with another agent about an invalid late fee. They said they were going to credit it but when I look they only took $26.79 off not the $42 that the late fee was, Why?
