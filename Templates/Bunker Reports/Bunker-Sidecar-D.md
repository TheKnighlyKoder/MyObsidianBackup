> [!tip]- 📖 System Manual: Property Definitions & Calibration
> ### **Hardware & Stability (Physical)**
> * **Physical Battery:**
> 	- 100% (Full Capacity): Rare; system at peak performance with no active interference.
> 	- 75% (Functional): Capable of standard chores, social engagement, and brand tasks.
> 	- 50% (Triage Mode): High friction; system resources must be split; choose physical OR cognitive work.
> 	- 25% (Critical): Survival mode; basic self-care only; system is "flickering."
> 	- 0% (Shutdown): Bed-bound; hardware non-operational; recovery is the only mission.
> * **Somatic Status:**
> 	- Grounded (Calm/Heavy): System is stable and "weighted" in a healthy way.
> 	- Stable: Normal background noise; pain is present but manageable.
> 	- High Idle (Nervous Buzzing): System is over-revving; internal tension or "static" is high.
> 	- System Flare: Acute pain, hardware interference, or active system crash.
> * **Daily Readiness (DEFCON):**
> 	- DEFCON 1 (All Systems Green): Normal readiness; internal environment is peaceful.
> 	- DEFCON 2 (Guarded/Stable): Increased vigilance; minor hardware interference detected.
> 	- DEFCON 3 (Triage/Limited): Restricted operations; mission parameters reduced to save battery.
> 	- DEFCON 4 (High-Alert/Imminent Crash): System failure likely; imminent threat to stability.
> 	- DEFCON 5 (Total Shutdown): Full system crash; maximum readiness/lockdown required.
> * **Sleep Quality:**
> 	- Restorative: Rare "Deep" sleep; waking up "In the Green" and recharged.
> 	- Standard: Average rest; baseline hardware maintenance achieved.
> 	- Fragmented: Sleep was broken by Nocturia, cramps, or pain.
> 	- Crash: Zero recovery; waking up "In the Red" or feeling un-slept.

> ### **Cognitive & Sensory Load**
> * **Cognitive Fog:**
> 	- Clear: High clarity; sharp word-recall and logical processing.
> 	- Light: Minor lag; slight difficulty focusing on complex data or tasks.
> 	- Moderate: Noticeable delay; "Dumb" feeling; significant focus drain.
> 	- Heavy: High word-retrieval failure; logic is compromised; losing track of sentences.
> 	- Blackout: Total dissociation; unable to process data or make simple decisions.
> * **SNHL Strain:**
> 	- Low: Quiet environment; no active decoding or lip-reading required.
> 	- Moderate: Background noise present; brain is working to decode audio.
> 	- Heavy: Chaotic environment; massive "Listening Fatigue" in progress.
> 	- Severe: Sensory saturation; decoding hardware has overloaded/shut down.
> * **Social Battery:**
> 	- 100% (Full): High capacity for complex social performance or connection.
> 	- 75% (Functional): Stable; social filtering (masking) is active but sustainable.
> 	- 50% (Low): Social "RAM" is filling up; retreating to digital or 1-on-1 interaction.
> 	- 25% (Flickering): Minimal capacity; processing human interaction feels like a manual task.
> 	- 0% (Empty): Total social burnout; isolation in the Bunker is mandatory.
> * **Window Zone:**
> 	- Optimal (Present/Flow): The "Green Zone"; calm, connected, and present.
> 	- Hyper-Arousal (Anxious/Racing): The "Red Zone"; Fight/Flight; racing heart/thoughts.
> 	- Hypo-Arousal (Freeze/Numb): The "Blue Zone"; Freeze/Fold; numbness or dissociation.
>

> ### **Identity & Armor (Psychological)**
> * **Masking Effort:**
> 	- Zero: Total Bunker safety; no need to perform "Normal."
> 	- Minimal: Light social filtering; feeling safe enough to be "clunky."
> 	- Moderate: Standard performance; using social scripts to pass.
> 	- Total Performance: Exhausting; 100% "Honors Student" mask in use.
> * **Armor Status:**
> 	- Reinforced: Safe/Open; identity is secure and no guarding is required.
> 	- Holding: Minimal guarding; system is stable and boundaries are set.
> 	- Thin: Braced for conflict or flare; armor is taking hits.
> 	- Compromised: Total masking; identity is under siege by external expectations.
> * **Utility Guilt:**
> 	- Zero: Rest is accepted as a tactical choice.
> 	- Low: Manageable "Should be doing more" thoughts are present.
> 	- Moderate: Significant pressure to prove value through production or chores.
> 	- High: Critical pressure; feeling that existence is only justified by "Utility."
> * **Mirror Narrative:**
> 	- Hostile: Accepting the lie that "Value = Output" or "Illness = Failure."
> 	- Neutral: Neither resisting nor accepting external views; holding the line.
> 	- Sovereign: High Agency; rejecting external reflections and brand pressures.
> * **Brand vs. Sovereign:**
> 	- Sovereign Heavy: Identity is centered on personal worth and Bunker safety.
> 	- Balanced: Maintaining Brand presence while protecting the self.
> 	- Brand Heavy: Immersed in the "Angry Nerd" persona; risk of self-neglect.
>

> ### **System Maintenance (Internal)**
> * **Hygiene Logistics:**
> 	- Full Reset: Shower and grooming; full hardware maintenance.
> 	- Maintenance: Sink wash, teeth, and basic body hygiene.
> 	- Minimal: Medications and hydration only.
> 	- Tactical Skip: Battery preservation; hygiene deferred for recovery.
> * **Hydration/Mineral Status:**
> 	- Optimal: Meds and potassium levels are balanced and stable.
> 	- Managed: Holding steady; no major metabolic symptoms detected.
> 	- Unstable: Twitchy, heavy, or metallic taste; symptoms are emerging.
> 	- Depleted: Acute RTA/CKD flare; mineral levels are dangerously low.
> * **Temperature Profile:**
> 	- Freezing / Cold: High bone pain, "Ice-Water" pain, and muscle spasm risk; system cannot warm up.
> 	- Optimal: Internal thermoregulation is balanced; minimal hardware drain.
> 	- Warm / Hot / Extreme Heat: Risk of RTA/mineral wasting, dizziness, and system overheating.
> * **Night Incident:**
> 	- None: No loss of bladder control during the sleep cycle.
> 	- Disrupted: Extreme urgency/Nocturia that broke sleep but no full incident.
> 	- Full Incident: Loss of bladder control during the sleep cycle.
> * **Daily Incident:**
> 	- None: Total control maintained during active/waking hours.
> 	- Managed: Minor urgency or leaks successfully managed with supplies.
> 	- Full Incident: Systemic loss of control during active/waking hours.
>

> ### **Operational Logistics & Environment (External)**
> * **Laundry Status:**
> 	- None Required: Environment is stable and clean.
> 	- Small: Minor upkeep needed to maintain baseline.
> 	- Emergency: Immediate load required for health, hygiene, or safety.
> 	- Deferred: Task recognized but postponed due to systemic friction.
> * **Laundry Location:**
> 	- Home Base: Laundry on-site; minimal travel/gravity cost.
> 	- Local: Laundromat in town; moderate travel and sensory cost.
> 	- City Ops: Laundromat in the city; high travel, gravity, and sensory tax.
> * **Weather Predicted:**
> 	- Clear: High light sensitivity risk; minimal joint friction.
> 	- Overcast: Low light strain; stable barometric pressure likely.
> 	- Rain: Increased humidity; potential for minor joint stiffness.
> 	- Storming: High risk of barometric pressure shifts and bone pain flares.
> 	- Snow: Extreme cold; high mobility risk and muscle spasm threat.
> * **Weather Actual:**
> 	- As Predicted: Forecast was accurate; system prepared correctly.
> 	- Heat Spike: Sudden rise; increased risk of RTA/mineral drain.
> 	- Cold Drop: Sudden fall; increased risk of joint/bone stiffness.
> 	- Pressure Shift: Significant barometric change; triggers fog and nerve pain.
