### **Business Report: Final Analysis of Proton VPN Tiers for Clan Operations**

To conclude our infrastructure strategy for the **Angry Sarge** brand, this summary defines the "best results" vs. "baseline protection" for your members. In 2026, Proton VPN remains the only reputable service where the free version is not a "trap," but the paid version provides the high-performance experience required for a premium video community.

---

### **1. The "Gold Standard" (Paid VPN Plus Plan)**

For members who can afford a few dollars a month, the paid plan is the "best results" option for two primary reasons: **Speed** and **Stability**.

- **Highest Speed:** Paid members get access to **10 Gbps servers**. This is critical for watching high-resolution training videos on your site without buffering.
    
- **NetShield (Ad & Malware Blocker):** This is a paid-only feature. It blocks trackers and malware at the DNS level. For a 2A community that might be targeted by "digital flaggers" or malicious scripts, this adds a massive layer of device-level protection.
    
- **10 Device Limit:** A member can protect their phone, tablet, and PC all under one account.
    
- **Server Selection:** They can manually choose a specific US city (e.g., "Dallas") to ensure the lowest possible latency to your Icelandic and Slovenian servers.
    

### **2. The "Baseline" (Free Plan)**

The free plan is a perfectly acceptable "safety net" for members who cannot or will not pay. It provides the **core security** without compromising their identity.

- **Unlimited Data:** Unlike almost every other free VPN, there are **no data caps**. They can watch as many videos as they want.
    
- **Same Encryption:** The free version uses the same AES-256 / WireGuard encryption as the paid version. Their ISP still sees nothing.
    
    +1
    
- **Privacy Parity:** Proton does not sell data or show ads to free users. Their "No-Logs" policy applies to everyone.
    
    +1

### **4. Recommended Community Message**

When you launch the new site, I recommend posting this "VPN Protocol" in your FAQ:

> **Clan Privacy Notice:**
> 
> "To keep this community sovereign and private, we recommend all members use a VPN with a **US-based IP**.
> 
> - **For the best experience:** Use **Proton VPN Plus**. It offers the fastest speeds for our Video Vault and includes NetShield to block trackers.
>     
> - **For a zero-cost option:** **Proton VPN Free** is highly recommended. It has no data limits and the same high-level encryption, though speeds may be slower during peak hours.
>     
>     +1
>     
> - **Requirement:** Regardless of your plan, please ensure your **Kill Switch** is turned ON in settings."
>     

### **Final Verdict**

The free plan is not a "lesser" security product; it is a "lesser" performance product. For a community starting out, the fact that members can get **Proton-level security for free** is a huge win for your brand’s growth and member retention.
