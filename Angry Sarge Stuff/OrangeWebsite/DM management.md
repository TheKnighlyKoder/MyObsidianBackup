## Strategic Business Report: Private Messaging & Manual Moderation Protocols

**To:** Strategic Stakeholders, Angry Sarge Brand

**Subject:** SOP for Admin-Led Private Message Management & Reporting

**Date:** February 14, 2026

**Jurisdiction:** Iceland (EEA / DSA Compliance)

---

### **I. Executive Summary**

As the brand transitions to Icelandic hosting in 2026, the management of Private Messages (DMs) moves from a "discretionary" task to a strictly regulated activity under the **Icelandic Electronic Communications Act (70/2022)** and the **EU Digital Services Act (DSA)**. To protect the brand’s **Intermediary Immunity**, the Admin Team must move away from "proactive monitoring" and toward a **"Notice-and-Action"** framework. This ensures that the Admin Team only acts when a specific violation is brought to their attention, thereby shielding the brand from overreaching privacy liabilities.

### **II. The "Passive Transit" Privacy Policy**

In 2026, the Admin Team will adopt a "Zero-Visibility" posture for DMs. This is a strategic legal choice designed to align with **GDPR Article 5 (Data Minimization)**.

- **Technical Blindness:** Administrators will intentionally restrict their own technical access to browse user DMs.
    
- **The Legal Benefit:** By not having a "God-mode" view, the Admin Team cannot be accused of having "Actual Knowledge" of illicit file-sharing until a formal report is filed. This preserves the **Safe Harbor** protection in Iceland.
    
- **Privacy Assurance:** This informs the community that their private correspondence is not being surveilled by staff, reinforcing the brand's commitment to user sovereignty.

### **III. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Reports**

Because the Admin Team does not proactively read DMs, all moderation actions must be **Reactive**. The following workflow will be the official response to reported misconduct:

|**Step**|**Action**|**Responsibility**|
|---|---|---|
|**1. The Flag**|A member reports a profile or a specific activity for a rule violation (e.g., 3D-printing file solicitation).|Member|
|**2. Initial Intake**|Admin Team receives a notification via the "Reports" dashboard or admin email.|Admin Team|
|**3. Evidence Request**|Admin Team contacts the reporter to request screenshots or a copy/paste of the offending message for verification.|Admin Team|
|**4. Verification**|Admins compare the evidence against the **3D-Printing Blacklist** and **Community Standards**.|Admin Team|
|**5. Enforcement**|Admin Team issues a formal warning, temporary suspension, or permanent ban.|Admin Team|

### **IV. Handling "Dirty" vs. "Clean" Evidence**

In the age of AI-faked content, the Admin Team must be vigilant about the quality of evidence provided in reports:

- **Primary Evidence:** Direct screenshots or text transcripts provided by a participant in the conversation.
    
- **Secondary Evidence:** Second-hand reports from users who "heard" something was happening. _Note: The Admin Team will not take action on hearsay without direct evidence._
    
- **Record Keeping:** All reports and the resulting admin actions must be logged for at least 6 months to satisfy **DSA Transparency Requirements**, should a user appeal their ban.

### **V. Regulatory Defense Strategy**

By utilizing this "Human-in-the-Loop" manual reporting system, the brand achieves the following protections:

1. **Exemption from Monitoring:** Under the **DSA (Article 8)**, hosting providers are not required to conduct general monitoring. By only acting on reports, the Admin Team proves the brand is a neutral intermediary.
    
2. **GDPR Compliance:** By only accessing DM data when a user "unlocks" it via a report, the brand follows the **Integrity and Confidentiality** principle of the GDPR.
    
3. **Liability Shield:** If a user emails a restricted file to another user via an address found in your DMs, the brand remains **0% liable** because the Admin Team took no part in facilitating the exchange and had no knowledge of it.

### **VI. Conclusion**

The Admin Team's role is not to be "police," but to be **"arbitrators."** We provide the sanctuary, and we only clean it when a mess is reported. This manual, report-based approach is the only way to operate a 2A-adjacent community in Iceland without falling afoul of the strict 2026 privacy and electronic communication directives.
