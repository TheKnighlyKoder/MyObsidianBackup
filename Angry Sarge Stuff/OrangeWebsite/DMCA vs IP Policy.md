### **Business Strategic Report: Document Infrastructure Migration**

**To:** Strategic Stakeholders, Angry Sarge

**Subject:** Transition from DMCA Compliance to Sovereign IP Policy

**Date:** February 14, 2026

#### **I. Strategic Decommissioning of DMCA**

The brand will officially decommission all references to the DMCA. In 2026, the DMCA is frequently weaponized by "Copyright Trolls" to silence 2A-focused media. By removing this policy, the brand eliminates the "automatic" mechanism that allows third parties to disable the site's media assets (training videos, product photography, etc.) without due process.

#### **II. Implementation of the Icelandic IP Framework**

The brand will adopt an **Intellectual Property Policy** anchored in the **Icelandic Copyright Act**. This policy will explicitly state:

1. **Jurisdiction:** All disputes must be settled in the **District Court of Reykjavik**.
    
2. **Due Process:** No content will be removed based on informal email notices. A valid court order from an Icelandic magistrate is required.
    
3. **Good Faith Cooperation:** The brand remains committed to protecting legitimate IP but requires that all claims follow international "Comity" (the recognition of Iceland's sovereign legal process).
    

#### **III. Resulting Business Resilience**

This transition ensures that **Angry Sarge HQ** remains online 24/7, even during active legal disputes. It prevents the "14-day blackout" periods common in US hosting, providing the community with uninterrupted access to its content and resources.

### **Final Recommendation for the Brand**

Do not use a "DMCA Generator." Use a custom **IP Policy** that names Iceland as your home. This turns your legal footer from a "white flag" into a "brick wall."
