## Refund and Returns Policy

We strive to provide high-quality products and services. However, we understand that sometimes issues may arise.

Generally, we do not offer returns or refunds. However, we may consider exceptions on a case-by-case basis for specific circumstances, such as defective products or significant errors in your order. Please note that custom orders and digital products are not eligible for return or refund**.**

If you believe you have a valid reason for a return or refund, you must [contact us](https://angrysargehq.com/contact-us/) within 7 days of receiving your order.

To be eligible for a return or refund, the item must be in new and unused condition.

If a return is approved, we will attempt to send a replacement item.  
If a replacement is not available, a one-time use discount code for the value of the returned item will be issued as store credit.

Shipping costs for returns are the responsibility of the customer, unless the return is due to a manufacturing defect. Please note that shipping issues caused by the carrier are not covered by this policy.

In the event that items are missing from your order, please [contact us](https://angrysargehq.com/contact-us/) within 7 days of receiving your order. We will work with you to resolve the issue as quickly as possible, which may include shipping the missing items or issuing a refund or store credit
